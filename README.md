# rustlang-projects
After 4+ years of C, this is my foray into rustlang. Will redo a couple of projects in Rust.
Will also try out WASM (Main reason why I'm trying out rust) and this is where I'll periodically
push the results of my adventure. Don't cringe too hard at my code. LOL

A lot of this code is based on Steve Klabnik's The Rust Programming Language.
Minigrep and hello(a small multi-threaded webserver) are the first decent programs.

Currently working on: LZW reimplementation
